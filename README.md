### What is this?
This is a simple C program I wrote, which sends spoofed ICMP Echo requests over the network.
Setting the destination address to a broadcast address (e.g. 255.255.255.255) and the "source" address to a target computer, one can use the power of all PCs in a network to DOS a single target.
